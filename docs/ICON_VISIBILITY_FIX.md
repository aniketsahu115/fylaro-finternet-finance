# Icon Disappearing on Hover - Fix Documentation

## Problem
Icons in the navbar buttons were disappearing when hovering over them.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by conflicting CSS hover states:
1. Custom `hover:text-primary` classes were conflicting with the button component's built-in hover styles
2. The button component has `hover:text-accent-foreground` which changes text color
3. Icons inherit the text color, causing visibility issues during color transitions

## Solution

### 1. Removed Conflicting CSS Classes
Removed custom hover classes from navbar buttons:
```tsx
// Before (problematic)
<Button className="text-muted-foreground hover:text-primary">

// After (fixed)
<Button className="navbar-button">
```

### 2. Added Custom CSS Classes
Created a dedicated `.navbar-button` class with proper hover behavior:
```css
.navbar-button {
  color: hsl(var(--muted-foreground));
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.navbar-button:hover {
  color: hsl(var(--foreground));
  background-color: hsl(var(--accent) / 0.5);
}
```

### 3. Ensured Icon Visibility
Added explicit CSS rules to prevent icons from disappearing:
```css
button svg {
  opacity: 1 !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
}

button:hover svg,
button:focus svg,
button:active svg {
  opacity: 1 !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` - Removed conflicting classes, added `.navbar-button`
2. `src/index.css` - Added custom CSS for proper icon visibility
3. `src/components/features/IconTestComponent.tsx` - Added test component for verification

## Testing
1. Hover over navbar icons (search, theme toggle, notifications, etc.)
2. Icons should remain visible and change color smoothly
3. No icons should disappear during hover transitions
4. Use the "Icon Visibility Test" component on the homepage for verification

## Prevention
- Avoid mixing custom hover classes with button component's built-in hover styles
- Use dedicated CSS classes for custom button styling
- Always test icon visibility after making hover state changes
- Use `!important` sparingly but when needed for critical visibility fixes

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ Search icon remains visible on hover
- ✅ Theme toggle icon remains visible on hover
- ✅ Bell notification icon remains visible on hover
- ✅ Globe/language icon remains visible on hover
- ✅ Mobile menu icon remains visible on hover
- ✅ All icons have smooth color transitions
- ✅ No icons flicker or disappear during hover
